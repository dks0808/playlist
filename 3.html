    They say oh my god I see the way you shine
    Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
    You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
    And now I beg to see you <strong>dance</strong> just one more time

    Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
    And oh my I, I, I like your style
    You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
    And now I beg to see you <strong>dance</strong> just one more time

    So they say
    <strong>Dance</strong> for me, <strong>dance</strong> for me, <strong>dance</strong> for me, oh, oh, oh
    I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
    They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay
    And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

    I said oh my god I see you walking by
    Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
    Just like a monkey I've been dancing my whole life
    But you just beg to see me <strong>dance</strong> just one more time

    Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
    And oh my I, I like your style
    You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
