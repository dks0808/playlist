    I got <strong>the good side</strong> of things
    Left you with both of the rings
    My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
    The change in the wind took you down to your knees
    I got <strong>the good side</strong> of you
    Sent it out into the blue
    The people danced to the sound of your heart
    The world sang along to it falling apart

    But I sympathize, and I recognize
    And baby, I apologize
    That I got <strong>the good side</strong>
    <strong>The good side</strong> of things

    I got <strong>the good side</strong> of life (good side of life)
    Traveled the universe twice (the universe twice)
    So many thoughts I wanted to share
    But I didn't call 'cause it wouldn't be fair
    Then I got <strong>the good side</strong> of new
    Found arms to fall right into
    I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
    And some day I hope that you'll understand

    I sympathize, and I recognize
    And baby, I apologize
    That I got <strong>the good side</strong>
    <strong>The good side</strong> of things

    I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
    And catch up on everything
    I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
    You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

    But I sympathize, and I recognize
    And baby, I apologize
    That I got <strong>the good side</strong>
    <strong>The good side</strong> of things
    Sympathize, recognize
    Apologize
    That I got <strong>the good side</strong>
    <strong>The good side</strong> of things
