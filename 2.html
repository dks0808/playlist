    <br>I got <strong>the good side</strong> of things
    <br>Left you with both of the rings
    <br>My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
    <br>The change in the wind took you down to your knees
    <br>I got <strong>the good side</strong> of you
    <br>Sent it out into the blue
    <br>The people danced to the sound of your heart
    <br>The world sang along to it falling apart
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>But I sympathize, and I recognize
    <br>And baby, I apologize
    <br>That I got <strong>the good side</strong>
    <br><strong>The good side</strong> of things
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>I got <strong>the good side</strong> of life (good side of life)
    <br>Traveled the universe twice (the universe twice)
    <br>So many thoughts I wanted to share
    <br>But I didn't call 'cause it wouldn't be fair
    <br>Then I got <strong>the good side</strong> of new
    <br>Found arms to fall right into
    <br>I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
    <br>And some day I hope that you'll understand
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>I sympathize, and I recognize
    <br>And baby, I apologize
    <br>That I got <strong>the good side</strong>
    <br><strong>The good side</strong> of things
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
    <br>And catch up on everything
    <br>I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
    <br>You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>But I sympathize, and I recognize
    <br>And baby, I apologize
    <br>That I got <strong>the good side</strong>
    <br><strong>The good side</strong> of things
    <br>Sympathize, recognize
    <br>Apologize
    <br>That I got <strong>the good side</strong>
    <br><strong>The good side</strong> of things
