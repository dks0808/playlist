  Spent all of our time outside, all day
  Doin' whatever we like, our way
  Didn't need a wall to build a new space
  Every moment just came together like

  Two feet hangin' in the water
  A few trees stood a little taller
  New breeze feels so <strong>good</strong>
  Can't help but remind me

  That it was a <strong>good day</strong> (yeah)
  Not much to do but just lay around
  Yeah, it was a <strong>good day</strong>
  I'm so glad the sun stayed around

  Yeah, it was a <strong>good day</strong>
  Not much to do but just lay around
  Yeah, it was a <strong>good day</strong>
  I'm so glad the sun stayed around

  No more school, no more rules
  No more room to feel these blues
  You and views all afternoon
  Look at all the time we don't have to give up

  Everything we're given is enough
  Moments fit together like a glove
  All my questions answered by this, love

  It was a <strong>good day</strong> (yeah)
  Not much to do but just lay around
  Yeah, it was a <strong>good day</strong>
  I'm so glad the sun stayed around

  Yeah, it was a <strong>good day</strong>
  Not much to do but just lay around
  Yeah, it was a <strong>good day</strong>
  I'm so glad the sun stayed around</span>
