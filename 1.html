  <p>
    <br>Spent all of our time outside, all day
    <br>Doin' whatever we like, our way
    <br>Didn't need a wall to build a new space
    <br>Every moment just came together like
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>Two feet hangin' in the water
    <br>A few trees stood a little taller
    <br>New breeze feels so <strong>good</strong>
    <br>Can't help but remind me
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>That it was a <strong>good day</strong> (yeah)
    <br>Not much to do but just lay around
    <br>Yeah, it was a <strong>good day</strong>
    <br>I'm so glad the sun stayed around
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>Yeah, it was a <strong>good day</strong>
    <br>Not much to do but just lay around
    <br>Yeah, it was a <strong>good day</strong>
    <br>I'm so glad the sun stayed around
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>No more school, no more rules
    <br>No more room to feel these blues
    <br>You and views all afternoon
    <br>Look at all the time we don't have to give up
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>Everything we're given is enough
    <br>Moments fit together like a glove
    <br>All my questions answered by this, love
  </p>
